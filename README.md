# Password Manager
This is a console application written in Python that manages passwords.  The application allows users to retrieve one of their passwords, generate a random password of a specified length, and change a password.  The passwords and services are stored in a text file called passwords.txt, but in future updates I plan to store the passwords in a more secure way.  

When the application runs, it asks for a master password.  The password is Shopify123.  The program then prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 4 to select an option.  

The passwords are stored in the following format:

service1,password1
service2,password2
service3,password3

Once again storing passwords in plain text like this is not secure at all.  This project was mainly to understand how to store information such as passwords in a file and be able to access them.  In future updates as I learn more about cybersecurity I will store the passwords in a safer way.
