# PasswordManager
This is a console application written in Python that manages passwords.  The application allows users to retrieve one of their passwords, generate a random password of a specified length, and change a password.  The passwords and services are stored in a text file called passwords.txt, but in future updates I plan to store the passwords in a more secure way.
